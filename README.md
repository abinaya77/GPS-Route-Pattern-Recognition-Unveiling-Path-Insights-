# GPS-Route-Pattern-Recognition-Unveiling Path Insights

PROPOSED WORK:

I spearheaded a product development internship project aimed at analyzing Google Maps routes(for given source to destination) to detect and identify patterns resembling alphabets or numbers, including inverted shapes. Utilizing a combination of geospatial libraries such as geopandas, shapely, networkx, osmnx, alongside data processing tools like pandas and numpy, we implemented advanced techniques including angle calculation and the haversine formula. Despite challenges such as path spoilers, like bends in a single straight street, we successfully identified over 30 distinct patterns across various locations. It's worth noting that the project is currently undergoing further development to address such complexities.

here are some of the identified pattern's screenshot for your reference
